# Projects

This repository contains some of my CAD's and FEA/CFD Analysis using ANSYS. These models highlight my expertise in 3D modelling, UAV design and structural/aerodynamic analysis. The repository is intended to support my application.

## Softwares Used
1. SolidWorks - For 3D modelling and assembly
2. ANSYS - For structural and aerodynamic Analysis

# Confidentiality Notice  
Most of my files, including CAD models, FEA/CFD simulations, and codes, are for my research projects and patent application. Because of this, I am unable to upload them at this time due to publication restrictions and confidentiality agreements.
