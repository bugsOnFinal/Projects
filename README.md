# Projects

This repository contains some of my CAD's and FEA/CFD Analysis using ANSYS. These models highlight my expertise in 3D modelling, UAV design and structural/aerodynamic analysis. The repository is intended to support my application.

## Softwares Used
1. SolidWorks - For 3D modelling and assembly
2. ANSYS - For structural and aerodynamic Analysis

# Confidentiality Notice  
Due to publication restrictions and confidentiality agreements, I'm unable to upload the CAD models, FEA, CFD simulation files, and codes related to my research projects and patent application at this time.
